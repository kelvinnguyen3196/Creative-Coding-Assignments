# Creative Coding Assignments
## Overview
I took Creative Coding because I was really interested in ways that I could use these programming skills that I have learned through college. As a computer science major most of the coursework that we do is theory based with our assignments based on the logic of our code with the way it is presented as a secondary thought. I've always been interested in art, so this class sounded really exciting because we would be working with a lot of front end technologies.

This course introduced us to the Processing GUI library for Java and the p5.js library for JavaScript. I had spent a few months learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this course and I hope to practice those skills and learn some more along the way!
